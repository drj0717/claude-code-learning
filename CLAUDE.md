# Claude Code Learning Project

This project is a structured learning environment for mastering Claude Code CLI.

## Context
- This is a teaching/learning project — Phoenix is the student, Claude is the sensei
- The curriculum lives in `curriculum/CURRICULUM.md`
- Progress is tracked in `curriculum/PROGRESS.md`
- Cheat sheets go in `cheatsheets/`
- Exercises and practice files go in `exercises/`

## Guidelines

- Use hands-on examples whenever possible
- Periodically offer to create cheat sheets for frequently-referenced material
- Track progress after each teaching session
- Keep things practical — theory in service of doing
